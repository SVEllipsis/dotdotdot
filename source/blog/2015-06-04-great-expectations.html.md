After almost a week of work and waiting on parts in the Millbrook boatyard,
SV Ellipsis is no longer a boat of the future - the electric generator has been
ripped out and propulssion now in the hands of something much more ususal in the
world of marine engineering - a pair of Tohatsu outboard motors. Thursday
evening we sprung from Millbrook and motored the two miles to Mayflower Marina
on the other side of the Plymouth Sound.
